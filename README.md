#Machine Learning API
The aim of this project is to develop a set of less than 5 endpoints that can be used by any person or organization to query a a known datapoint against a model (Uploaded in SIMPLE CSV file) and get the propability of the datapoint being in a specific category/classify, the nearest neighbourhood or remomended class.

We will endevor to make it

#Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms by just going to HTTPS Endpoints
#Fast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine

Machine Learning - Restful API for Dummies provides a means for non-developers to use Restful API to query a CSV for Categorisation, Nearest K Neighbours, Recommendation ML problems using a simple HTTPS Endpoint.
